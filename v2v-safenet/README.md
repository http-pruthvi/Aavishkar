## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Real-time GPS Tracking** - Tracks vehicle position and speed every 500ms
- ✅ **Live Vehicle Synchronization** - Instant data sharing via Firebase Realtime Database
- ✅ **Collision Prediction** - Time-to-Collision (TTC) algorithm for accurate risk assessment
- ✅ **Brake Alert System** - Detects and broadcasts sudden braking events
- ✅ **Interactive Map** - Color-coded vehicle markers (Blue/Orange/Red) based on risk level
- ✅ **Visual Alerts** - Popup warnings with blinking animations for high-risk scenarios
- ✅ **Modern UI** - Glassmorphism design with smooth animations
- ✅ **Multi-Device Support** - Works on desktop and mobile browsers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A Firebase account (free tier works fine)
- Modern web browser with geolocation support

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project**
   ```bash
   cd v2v-safenet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   
   a. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   
   b. Create a new project (or use existing)
   
   c. Enable **Realtime Database**:
      - Go to Build → Realtime Database
      - Click "Create Database"
      - Start in **test mode** (for development)
   
   d. Get your Firebase config:
      - Go to Project Settings → General
      - Scroll to "Your apps" → Web app
      - Copy the configuration object
   
   e. Update `src/config/firebase.js` with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
     databaseURL: "https://YOUR_PROJECT-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Grant location permissions when prompted

## 🧪 Testing & Demo

### Single Device Test
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Grant location permissions
3. Check the Firebase console to see your vehicle data being updated

### Multi-Device Test (Recommended)
1. **Option A - Multiple Browser Tabs**:
   - Open the app in 2+ tabs
   - Each tab will have a unique vehicle ID
   - Move your device to see all instances update

2. **Option B - Multiple Devices**:
   - Open the app on your phone and laptop
   - Grant location permissions on both
   - Walk around with your phone to simulate movement
   - Watch collision alerts trigger as you approach

3. **Option C - Simulated Movement**:
   - Open in two tabs
   - Use browser dev tools to spoof GPS location
   - Simulate vehicles approaching each other

### What to Look For
- ✅ Vehicles appear on the map in real-time
- ✅ Markers change color based on proximity (Blue → Orange → Red)
- ✅ Collision warning popup appears when TTC < 3 seconds
- ✅ Brake alert banner shows when a vehicle decelerates rapidly
- ✅ Info panel updates with nearest vehicle distance and risk level

## 📊 How It Works

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Device 1  │ ◄─────► │   Firebase   │ ◄─────► │   Device 2  │
│  (Browser)  │         │   Realtime   │         │  (Browser)  │
└─────────────┘         │   Database   │         └─────────────┘
                        └──────────────┘
```

### Collision Detection Algorithm

1. **Distance Calculation**: Haversine formula for GPS coordinates
2. **Relative Speed**: Difference in velocities between vehicles
3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: `TTC = distance / relative_speed`
4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - **HIGH**: TTC < 3 seconds
   - **MEDIUM**: 3 < TTC < 5 seconds
   - **LOW**: TTC > 5 seconds or no collision path

### Brake Detection

Monitors speed changes over 1-second intervals:
- If speed drops > 20 km/h in 1 second → Broadcast brake alert
- Other vehicles receive instant notification

## 🎨 UI Components

- **VehicleMap**: Leaflet-based map with custom vehicle markers
- **CollisionAlert**: Animated warning popups and banners
- **VehicleInfoPanel**: Real-time status dashboard
- **Color Coding**:
  - 🟢 Green: Your vehicle
  - 🔵 Blue: Normal (safe distance)
  - 🟠 Orange: Caution (approaching)
  - 🔴 Red: Danger (collision risk)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **Map**: Leaflet + React-Leaflet
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Styling**: CSS with glassmorphism effects
- **Geolocation**: Browser Geolocation API

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS)
- ⚠️ Requires HTTPS for geolocation (localhost works for testing)

## 🔒 Security Notes

**For Production Use**:
1. Update Firebase security rules:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "vehicles": {
         "$vehicleId": {
           ".write": "auth != null",
           ".read": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Enable Firebase Authentication
3. Use environment variables for sensitive config
4. Deploy over HTTPS

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Predictive path visualization
- [ ] Voice alerts
- [ ] Integration with vehicle OBD-II
- [ ] Machine learning for better predictions
- [ ] Emergency vehicle priority alerts

## 🎓 Hackathon Tips

### Demo Script
1. **Introduction** (30 sec): Explain V2V communication problem
2. **Live Demo** (2 min): Show two devices approaching → alert triggers
